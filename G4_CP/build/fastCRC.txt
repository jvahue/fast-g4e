Converting fast.elf to fast.dld
using S8 and S2 records
.
Computing and Adding CRC to fast.dld
Input/Output File Types are SREC/SREC respectively.
Output 1 Section image file.
Machine is big endian with 16 bit data access.
Section 0 size is 800000 bytes and will be output ----------------------------
IDed address range is 0x100000..0x0, pre-filled with 0xff
Checksum address: 0x0, size is 0 bits, operands are 32 bits
CRC address is 0x0, the polynomial is 0x8005 and it is 32 bits.
CRC Type is Bytewise, CRC initial value is 0xffffffff, CRC operands are 8 bits.
Lines containing only the fill pattern will not be output.

Section 0 CRC 0x5c41fab6, written to address 0x0018a640
--- Open fast.dld output file
Section 0 filled with 566876 (0x0008a65c) bytes, utilization is 70.86%
--- Total bytes written to memory 566876 (0x0008a65c), utilization is 70.86%
